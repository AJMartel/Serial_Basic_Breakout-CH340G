This is a CH340G based board that converts USB to Serial. It follows the standard Arduino pin out so this can be used to program the Pro and Pro Mini line of Arduinos. It can also be used as a general serial device for debugging (such as with a GPS module).

Board is default 5V output and 5V serial signals but cutting the trace on the back of the board and soldering a jumper to 3.3V changes the 5V pin to output 3.3V and changes serial comm signals to 3.3V.
